Live map visualization of all pokemon in your area with options to also show gyms, filter pokemon, localization, and pokestops. This is a proof of concept. Currently runs on a Flask server displaying a custom Google Map with markers on it.

Using this software is against the ToS and can get you banned. Use at your own risk.

Building off [Mila432](https://github.com/Mila432/Pokemon_Go_API)'s PokemonGo API, [tejado's additions](https://github.com/tejado/pokemongo-api-demo), [leegao's additions](https://github.com/leegao/pokemongo-api-demo/tree/simulation) and [Flask-GoogleMaps](https://github.com/rochacbruno/Flask-GoogleMaps).
